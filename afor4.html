    <p>Donald Ervin Knuth has given a list of five properties for a,algorithm, these properties are: 
1) Finiteness: An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps. It means after every step one reach closer to solution of the problem and after a finite number of steps algorithm reaches to an end point. 
2) Definiteness: Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined. It is done by well thought actions to be performed at each step of the algorithm. Also the actions are defined unambiguously for each activity in the algorithm. 
3) Input: Any operation you perform need some beginning value/quantities associated with different activities in the operation. So the value/quantities are given to the algorithm before it begins. 
4) Output: One always expects output/result (expected value/quantities) in terms of output from an algorithm. The result may be obtained at different stages of the algorithm. If some result is from the intermediate stage of the operation then it is known as intermediate result and result obtained at the end of algorithm is known as end result. The output is expected value/quantities always have a specified relation to the inputs . </p>

    <p>Algorithm can be defined as: “A sequence of activities to be processed for getting desired output from a given input.” Webopedia defines an algorithm as: “A formula or set of steps for solving a particular problem. To be an algorithm, a set of rules must be unambiguous and have a clear stopping point”. There may be more than one way to solve a problem, so there may be more than one algorithm for a problem. Now, if we take definition of algorithm as: “A sequence of activities to be processed for getting desired output from a given input.” Then we can say that: 1. Getting specified output is essential after algorithm is executed. 2. One will get output only if algorithm stops after finite time. 3. Activities in an algorithm to be clearly defined in other words for it to be unambiguous. Before writing an algorithm for a problem, one should find out what is/are the inputs to the algorithm and what is/are expected output after running the algorithm. Now let us take some exercises to develop an algorithm for some simple problems: While writing algorithms we will use following symbol for different operation

    Intelligence is one of the key characteristics which differentiate a human being from other living creatures on the earth. Basic intelligence covers day to day problem solving and making strategies to handle different situations which keep arising in day to day life. One person goes Bank to withdraw money. After knowing the balance in his account, he/she decides to with draw the entire amount from his account but he/she has to leave minimum balance in his account. Here deciding about how much amount he/she may with draw from the account is one of the examples of the basic intelligence. During the process of solving any problem, one tries to find the necessary steps to be taken in a sequence. In this Unit you will develop your understanding about problem solving and approaches. 
 
1.2 PROBLEM SOLVING 
Can you think of a day in your life which goes without problem solving? Answer to this question is of course, No. In our life we are bound to solve problems. In our day to day activity such as purchasing something from a general store and making payments, depositing fee in school, or withdrawing money from bank account. All these activities involve some kind of problem solving. It can be said that whatever activity a human being or machine do for achieving a specified objective comes under problem solving. To make it clearer, let us see some other examples. 
Example1: If you are watching a news channel on your TV and you want to change it to a sports channel, you need to do something i.e. move to that channel by pressing that channel number on your remote. This is a kind of problem solving.
